##### Unique Identifier

The company unique identifier is a company specific identifier which is used to help companies to prove their identity. In Catena-X registration party needs to add minimum one unqiue identifier which is later used inside the application verification flow to identifier the companies identity.
To support the user entry and ensure that human errors are reduced, an endpoint to fetch the allowed unique identifier (per country) as well as field input validations are implemented.


##### Logic implemented for the country specific identifier

The unique identifier is a location based attribute; means, after the user entered a country code; the FE needs to fetch the possible company identifier via an api call an display them inside the new FE dropdown field (see details below)

initially when opening the registration form step 1 "company data"; the unique identifier section is not displayed.
Only when entering the country code; the unique id section is getting displayed (see screen below)

```dif
! GET /api/registration/company/country/{alpha2Code}/uniqueidentifiers
```

###### API Response

###### POST allowed Unique Identifier

no post call existing. The data will get stored as part of the POST /companyDetailsWithAddress endpoint

<br>
<br>


##### Store / Save Company Data Registration Details
<br>
Via the post request, all company details will get stored/saved inside the portal db. The endpoint is used for both methods (manual data entering as well as the bpdm interface usage).  
<br>

```diff
! POST /api/registration/application/{applicationId}/companyDetailsWithAddress
```
