In step 1, the user is asked to add the company details

* a) via BPN search and automatic data load

* b) adding the data manually
  * Legal Entity Name
  * Registration Name
  * Legal Entity Street
  * House Number
  * Postal Code
  * City
  * Country
  * NEW Unique ID such as Handelsregister, Tax ID, etc.
<br>
<br>

#### API Details

##### Display Company Data Registration Details (pre-saved)

###### a) via BPN search and automatic data load

```diff
! GET /api/registration/legalEntityAddress/{bpn}
```

The endpoint is fetching the company data (if existing) from the bpdm data pool.
Portal backend transfers the bpdm data pool response for the protal FE to display all relevant information. (similar structure as the portal db GET response)

		  {
		    "bpn": "BPNL00000007OH84",
		    "countryAlpha2Code": "DE",
		    "name": "TEST_GAIA_X",
		    "shortName": "TEST_GAIA_X",
		    "city": "Sindelfingen",
		    "streetName": "Hauptstrasse 2",
		    "region": null,
		    "streetAdditional": null,
		    "streetNumber": "2",
		    "zipCode": "71067",
		    "uniqueIds": [
			{
			    "type": "COMMERCIAL_REG_NUMBER",
			    "value": "HRB2344553"
			}, 
			{
			    "type": "VAT_ID",
			    "value": "DE78338833"
			}
		    ]} 
<br>

###### a) adding the data manually

```diff
! GET /api/registration/application/{applicationId}/companyDetailsWithAddress
```

Details about the BPDM data call can get found in the Interface / API Call specification: BPDM - Get/Post Company Data

##### Unique Identifier

The company unique identifier is a company specific identifier which is used to help companies to prove their identity. In Catena-X registration party needs to add minimum one unqiue identifier which is later used inside the application verification flow to identifier the companies identity.
To support the user entry and ensure that human errors are reduced, an endpoint to fetch the allowed unique identifier (per country) as well as field input validations are implemented.
<br>

##### Logic implemented for the country specific identifier

The unique identifier is a location based attribute; means, after the user entered a country code; the FE needs to fetch the possible company identifier via an api call an display them inside the new FE dropdown field (see details below)

initially when opening the registration form step 1 "company data"; the unique identifier section is not displayed.
Only when entering the country code; the unique id section is getting displayed (see screen below)

```dif
! GET /api/registration/company/country/{alpha2Code}/uniqueidentifiers
```

<br>

###### API Response

		[
		  {
		    "id": 1,
		    "label": "COMMERCIAL_REG_NUMBER"
		  },
		  {
		    "id": 2,
		    "label": "VAT_ID"
		  }
		]

<br>

###### Result on UI

<br>

**NOTE**
Unique identifier handling
3 possible scenarios; when fetching the co

* no unique identifier
* only one unique identifier (happy path)
* multiple identifier
 
#A - no unique identifier
Same as the manual flow => user needs to select the unique identifier type and enter the id

#B - only one unique identifier (happy path)
The ID is getting auto displayed and can not get changed by the user

#C - multiple identifier
In case that multiple identifier are submitted, the user needs to be able to select the preferred used identifier.  
<br>

Below you can find an example of the implemented design for "multiple identifier"

###### Implemented Pattern

###### POST allowed Unique Identifier

no post call existing. The data will get stored as part of the POST /companyDetailsWithAddress endpoint

<br>
<br>


##### Store / Save Company Data Registration Details
<br>
Via the post request, all company details will get stored/saved inside the portal db. The endpoint is used for both methods (manual data entering as well as the bpdm interface usage).  
<br>

```diff
! POST /api/registration/application/{applicationId}/companyDetailsWithAddress
```
