## Open API - Create new Connector Registration - managed 

In the connector registration scenario OpenAPIs are offered for managed connector registration.  
To be able to run the interface, a technical user is needed which can get generated easily via the user management.

Service Provider can create a new registration for a company which subscribed for a service provider service

Same as for self-owned connectors, the connector registration will automatically 

* register the connector in the daps authentication service (with the public key uploaded inside the connector registration UI / endpoint)
* trigger the SD Factory to create the self-description of the connector

<br>

If connector data have been successfully stored; DAPS auth has been successful and SD is created and stored; the connector record will receive the status "ACTIVE". Technical explanation: if the connector.daps_registration_successful is "true" and connector.self_description_document_id is != NULL; connector status is "ACTIVE"
