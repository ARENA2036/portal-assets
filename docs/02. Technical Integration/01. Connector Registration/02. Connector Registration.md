## Connector Registration

#### Create new Connector Registration - self-owned

New connector registration can get triggered/created by using the "Register Connector" function.
The registration will automatically trigger the daps certificate via the public key which was uploaded by the user. Same applies for the Self-Description of the connector.

In case the DAPS is failing, the connector will still get registered and DAPS registration will be hold on "PENDING". In the scenario of an PENDING connector; the user will be enabled to retrigger the missing service registration (in this case DAPS) to enable the usage of the connector inside the network fully.

#### Create new Connector Registration - managedÂ 

In the scenario of a managed connector; the customer will order/purchase a managed connector via the service marketplace.
The service provider will be able to register the connector in the name of the customer. In this scenario; the service provider might use the ui function offered by the portal or directly executes the registration via direct API call.

In the scenario of an managed connector; the connector will be displayed on the customer side; same applies for the technical user and the service provider is stored as connector issuer.
