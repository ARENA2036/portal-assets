#### Migrate existing user accounts to the new created IdP

With the configuration of a new IdP, existing user accounts should not get lost. In the previous section "Create the new idp record" it was already described, how the admin user can connect his/her existing user account with the new company idp. In this section the user migration of additional available user accounts is handled.
<br>

For the migration of additional existing user accounts, which have been created under the shared IdP previously, the administrator can call the user migration list via the IdP config page.

</p>

<br>

By clicking on the "Users" sub-navigation icon, a overlay with the user migration list as json or csv file is getting displayed.

</p>

<br>

Download the list and add for each user, which is supposed to get migrated, the company idp unique identifier into the list as <strong>ProviderUserID</strong> upload the list again by placing in inside the upload area and wait for the success message that all the users have been migrated / added.

</p>

<br>

With that, the user migration is successfully done - you can validate the user list again by re-opening the users list of the IdP.
After the successful config, the new IdP can get enabled and the old IdP can get disabled.
