### Register your company IdP

To register your company idp, login with administration rights and open the "Identity Provider Config" via the top right user navigation.
Inside the config, you will find your current registered (enabled and disabled) identity providers - quite oftne this will only be one identity provider. As well as the option to register a new identity provider (such as you company idp).

<br>

Please note - for the company identity provider conenction you will need to prepare certain information to be able to connect your company IdP. Please ansure that all necessary information are available.

Currenly only the connection for OIDC idp's is supported.
<br>
<br>

#### Create the new idp record

Click on "Add Identity Provider" to start the registration.
Inside the overlay a idp name will need to get added. This will be the display name of your IdP. Means users which try to login to CX will see this login option. Use a name which users can understand and know that this belongs to their company.

By clicking on "Next".

On the upcoming screen the idp relevant connection information need to get added.
Those are
- metadata url
- client ID (created in your company IdP)
- client secret (created in your company IdP)
<br>

if the config was sucessful, you will get asked to add your personal company idp unique identifier. In this step you will connect your exosting catena-x user account (with your already assigned roles and customized configurations) with your company IdP. To do this successfully, you need to add your company IdP unqiue ID.  
<br>

With the confirm/submit button the value will get stored successfully and you can now test the successful company IdP integration by doing a logout and trying to login with your company credentials and company IdP.
Please note: in this moment, your user is connected with the Catena-X Shared IdP as well as your company IdP. This means, if after the logout and new login via your company IdP you might find out, that the login via the company IdP might not work (due to wrong configuration) you still can login to catena-X with the previous used IdP and correct the IdP config.  
<br>

As soon as you have successfully tested the login, please proceed with the user migration => see next chapter.

<br>
<br>

#### Migrate existing user accounts to the new created IdP

With the configuration of a new IdP, existing user accounts should not get lost. In the previous section "Create the new idp record" it was already described, how the admin user can connect his/her existing user account with the new company idp. In this section the user migration of additional available user accounts is handled.
<br>

For the migration of additional existing user accounts, which have been created under the shared IdP previously, the administrator can call the user migration list via the IdP config page.  
<br>

By clicking on the "Users" sub-navigation icon, a overlay with the user migration list as json or csv file is getting displayed.

Download the list and add for each user, which is supposed to get migrated, the company idp unique identifier into the list as <strong>ProviderUserID</strong> upload the list again by placing in inside the upload area and wait for the success message that all the users have been migrated / added.
<br>

<br>

With that, the user migration is successfully done - you can validate the user list again by re-opening the users list of the IdP.
After the successful config, the new IdP can get enabled and the old IdP can get disabled.
