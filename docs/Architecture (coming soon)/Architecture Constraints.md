# Architecture Constraints

* Homogenous UI/UX design across all user facing elements.

* Run anywhere: can be deployed as a docker image, e. g. on Kubernetes (platform-independent, cloud, on prem or local).

* Modular design: core-components are loosely coupled.

* Freedom of choice for technology components stops where UX is negatively impacted. (currently under revision by the overall catena architecture roundtable)

* OpenSource software first

* Multi Language: German and english to be supported as a minimum
