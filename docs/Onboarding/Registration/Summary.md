# Summary
<br>

The registration process includes the onboarding of an organization. A natural person does not need an onboarding in Catena-X.
<br>
<br>
The registration process of an organization involves a person belonging to the organization and who is authorized acting on behalf of the organization.

Pre-condition: The authorized organization onboarding party must have received a Catena-X invite and needs to have valid documents of the organization (e.g. commercial register excerpt, certifications).

### Registration Steps

#### Registration Login

With the login of the user to the registration, the available (if any) application data will get loaded. If the application form is first time opened or if no data have been saved previously, the user will start with a fresh/empty registration form.
<br>
<br>

#### Introduction

On the first screen after login, a short introduction/preview of the upcoming steps will be displayed.
<br>
<br>

#### Add Company Data

The first application form page is expecting the company data.
Two options are available:
- add company data manually
- use your business partner number (if known) to auto fill the company data

In case the manual data entering is used, the user will need to submit
- Company Name
- Legal Address
	- Street
	- House Number (if relevant)
	- ZipCode
	- City
	- Country
	- Country specific unique id (such as tax id or commercial register number)

#### Invite additional users

#optional step#

The 2nd step inside the registration form is optional. Means, the user can invite additional company members if support in the registration is needed.
Normally this should only be relevant if an user is not authorized to finish the registration in the name of the company. E.g. missing rights to agree to terms and conditions or similar scenarios.

With the invite of an user, a personal message can get entered to ensure that the invited user knows the purpose of the invite.
Below an example of the email send to the invited user is shared:
