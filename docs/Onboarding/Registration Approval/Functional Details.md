### Add/Update BPN for the registration company
<br>
The bpn can get manually added (as an workaround) if the registration company request doesnt have a business partner number added and the registration request is in status "submitted".

<br>
BPNs can only get added by CX Admin's.
As mentioned above, the implementation is a workaround only and will get replaced by the actual bpn connection as soon as the reference implementation is available.
