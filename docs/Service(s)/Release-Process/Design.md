# Summary

The service publish process is currently under creation and will be UI supported in release 3.1 or 3.2

Till that, the service publication is only available via api endpoints. Users can trigger those endpoints to generate a new service. The service approval (which is needed to get the service published on the marketplace, needs to get triggered by the portal administrator)
