## Summary

In the initial implementation of the reference implementation, possible network participants need to get actively invited by the CX Admin to register for the platform.
Therefore the CX Admin got a own administration board created, where current ongoing registration can get viewed and new registrations are creatable.

Outlook - following functions are under analysis:
- "Invite new nember" by triggering an invite initiated by any existing CX Member which is already successfully registered
- Disable "invite" and let everyone register
- Enable cross network registration syncronization
