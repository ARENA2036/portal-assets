# Summary
<br>

The registration process includes the onboarding of an organization. A natural person does not need an onboarding in Catena-X.
<br>
<br>
The registration process of an organization involves a person belonging to the organization and who is authorized acting on behalf of the organization.

Pre-condition: The authorized organization onboarding party must have received a Catena-X invite and needs to have valid documents of the organization (e.g. commercial register excerpt, certifications).

### Registration Steps

#### Registration Login

With the login of the user to the registration, first the application record with status is getting loaded via the portal db.
Based on the fetched status; the frontend logic will decide how the user proceeds.  
<br>

1. If the status is any status before "SUBMITTED" (< id "7"); the company registration form gets displayed; starting with the introduction screen.  
If company registration data have been previously added/saved already, the data will be displayed inside the registration form; otherwise an empty registration form woll be displayed. 
3. If the status is in status "SUBMITTED" (= id "7"); the information screen "application in validation" screen is getting displayed.

5. If the status is in status "APPROVED" (= id "8"); the user should get redirected to the portal "home" page  

7. If the status is in status "DECLINED" (= id "9"); the information screen "application declined and closed" screen is getting displayed

#### Introduction

On the first screen after login, a short introduction/preview of the upcoming steps will be displayed.
<br>
<br>

#### Add Company Data

The first application form page is expecting the company data.
Two options are available:
- add company data manually
- use your business partner number (if known) to auto fill the company data

In case the manual data entering is used, the user will need to submit
- Company Name
- Legal Address
	- Street
	- House Number (if relevant)
	- ZipCode
	- City
	- Country
	- Country specific unique id (such as tax id or commercial register number)


#### Invite additional users

#optional step#

The 2nd step inside the registration form is optional. Means, the user can invite additional company members if support in the registration is needed.
Normally this should only be relevant if an user is not authorized to finish the registration in the name of the company. E.g. missing rights to agree to terms and conditions or similar scenarios.

With the invite of an user, a personal message can get entered to ensure that the invited user knows the purpose of the invite.
Below an example of the email send to the invited user is shared:

#### Company Role & Terms and Conditions

Under step 3 "Company Roles & Agreements" the applicator is requested to select the company role with which the application company want to participate inside the network. Beside the "Active Participant", "App Provider" and "Service Provider" are available. Depending on the role, the network agreements/terms and conditions which the application company needs to agree on are getting displayed. Also, the role i relevant to manage the respective access rights/permissions which the application company will receive inside the Catena-X network.  
The role can get easily enhanced in future by enhancing or reducing the role inside the company configuration (available inside the CX Portal).

#### Document upload

In Step 4, the users are asked to upload the company identification.
<br>
All documents uploaded under the same application register form are shown. If a second user has already uploaded a doc, the user will be able to see as well as delete this document as weel; as long as the users belong to the same company application.

<br>
<br>

#### Submit company data

The last step of the company application is the verification of the data.
The user can revalidate if al data are correctly added. In case anything is wrong or missing, the "back" button will support to update any entered data.  
<br>

With the submit of the application, the application form is getting closed and the company application data are submitted for review to the platform operator. The application verification will run through a number of identification validations as well as technical setup to enable the company to participate inside the dataspace.
