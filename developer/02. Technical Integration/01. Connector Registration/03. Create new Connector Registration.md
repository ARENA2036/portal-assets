## 1. Create new Connector Registration - self-owned

<br>
<img width="1200" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94133633/217815649-14aa6281-81bc-480b-9bf3-dd6a8264b20c.png">

<br>

The user can create a new connector registration by using the connector POST call.
<br>
The registration will automatically 
* register the connector in the daps authentication service (with the public key uploaded inside the connector registration UI / endpoint)
* trigger the SD Factory to create the self-description of the connector

<br>

If connector data have been successfully stored; DAPS auth has been successful and SD is created and stored; the connector record will receive the status "ACTIVE".
Technical explanation: if the connector.daps_registration_successful is "true" and connector.self_description_document_id is != NULL; connector status is "ACTIVE"

<br>
<br>

Connector "Pending" status scenarios:
* if the connector.daps_registration_successful is "false" and connector.self_description_document_id is != NULL
* if the connector.daps_registration_successful is "false" and connector.self_description_document_id is = NULL
* if the connector.daps_registration_successful is "true" and connector.self_description_document_id is = NULL

>Validate the connector URL

>Connector Owner

<br>
<br>

#### Logical flow of the service

* fetch the user id from the user token calling the POST call
* from the user token user_id get via the table iam_user the company_user_id
* fetch via the company_user_id the company id which is used has host and provider of the edc
* input data as well as the backend fetched company id's are send to the SD factory to create the connector self-description with connection to the wallet
* after successful self-description creation, the edc details as well as the self-description document are getting stored inside the portal database
* last the daps is getting triggered to register the connector inside the daps authentication service; in case the service fails; the user will get informed and needs to retrigger the daps

## 2. Create new Connector Registration - managedÂ 

Service Provider can create a new registration for a company which subscribed for a service provider service

Same as for self-owned connectors, the connector registration will automatically 
* register the connector in the daps authentication service (with the public key uploaded inside the connector registration UI / endpoint)
* trigger the SD Factory to create the self-description of the connector

<br>

If connector data have been successfully stored; DAPS auth has been successful and SD is created and stored; the connector record will receive the status "ACTIVE".
Technical explanation: if the connector.daps_registration_successful is "true" and connector.self_description_document_id is != NULL; connector status is "ACTIVE"

#### Logical flow of the service

* fetch the user id from the user token calling the POST call
* from the user token user_id get via the table iam_user the company_user_id
* use the company_user_id to retrieve the company_id
* validate if a service request is active between service provider company and to be registered connector company
* if record found, proceed
* if not, block and send back an error
