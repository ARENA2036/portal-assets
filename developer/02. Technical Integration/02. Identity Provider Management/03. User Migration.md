#### Migrate existing user accounts to the new created IdP

With the configuration of a new IdP, existing user accounts should not get lost. In the previous section "Create the new idp record" it was already described, how the admin user can connect his/her existing user account with the new company idp. In this section the user migration of additional available user accounts is handled.
<br>

For the migration of additional existing user accounts, which have been created under the shared IdP previously, the administrator can call the user migration list via the IdP config page.

By clicking on the "Users" sub-navigation icon, a overlay with the user migration list as json or csv file is getting displayed.

Download the list and add for each user, which is supposed to get migrated, the company idp unique identifier into the list as <strong>ProviderUserID</strong> upload the list again by placing in inside the upload area and wait for the success message that all the users have been migrated / added.

<br>

With that, the user migration is successfully done - you can validate the user list again by re-opening the users list of the IdP.
After the successful config, the new IdP can get enabled and the old IdP can get disabled.
