# Implementation
<br>


## Registration Login

With the login of the user to the registration, first the application record with status is getting loaded via the portal db.
Based on the fetched status; the frontend logic will decide how the user proceeds.  
<br>

1. If the status is any status before "SUBMITTED" (< id "7"); the company registration form gets displayed; starting with the introduction screen.  
If company registration data have been previously added/saved already, the data will be displayed inside the registration form; otherwise an empty registration form woll be displayed.
3. If the status is in status "SUBMITTED" (= id "7"); the information screen "application in validation" screen is getting displayed.

5. If the status is in status "APPROVED" (= id "8"); the user should get redirected to the portal "home" page  

7. If the status is in status "DECLINED" (= id "9"); the information screen "application declined and closed" screen is getting displayed
