## Clients


### Overview Clients
Clients are entities that can request Keycloak to authenticate a user. Most often, clients are applications and services that want to use Keycloak to secure themselves and provide a single sign-on solution.

Clients can have 3 different client types

* public (For client-side clients that perform browser logins. As it is not possible to ensure that secrets can be kept safe with client-side clients, it is important to restrict access by configuring correct redirect URIs)
* confidential (For server-side clients that perform browser logins and require client secrets when making an Access Token Request. This setting should be used for server-side applications)
* bearer-only (The application allows only bearer token requests. When turned on, this application cannot participate in browser logins)

### Client Creation

clients are created with the portal & marketplace services:
* App Services
* Service Services

Manual creation of clients is not expected/needed

### Initial Client Load

In the initial system deployment/data load provided by the catena-x migration script, the relevant core clients are included.
